MegaWidget International is considering building a new facility so that it can manufacture more of the products it sells, and requires a loan to finance the new factory. Before the leadership team makes a final decision,they need a financial model to determine if such a project is likely to be financially viable.

**_Disclaimer_** : _This is not a real company, it is an assignment task carried out as part of my coursework_. 

### Problem Statement
1. Is taking the proposed loan viable, does changing the loan term make a difference.
2. How does introducing a discount scheme affect company profits
3. Assume a 5% increase in monthly sales starting from Dec 2022, will it make the proposed loan viable.
4. What is the effect of switching to a flat-rate delivery charge (regardless of the size of the order).
5. What effect will fluctuations in sales have on profit.
